TO DO LIST:

1. Get rid of the plus icon for the tabcontrol

2. Add webBrowser control - leads to Gmail
   (Using OAuth)

3. Add an inbox/important/spam/trash control that syncs with newly popped up mail

4. Add an important/trash/spam icon that MOVES the mail to the other tab controls

5. Add a search menu to look up SPECIFIC mail

!!IMPORTANT: Make sure screen size automatically adjusts to the screen (NEEDS TO BE FIXED)!!
VERSION 2:
Implements label - Pinned into the inbox 
-> as user proceeds to click on the "pin" icon, it brings the item into the pinned LABEL (within Gmail)



**Controls I need CURRENTLY:
Webview container (gmail application + sign in)  --> (webview)
Container for LIST (inbox) --> (listview, gridview)
container for text box (search bar) --> (text box)
text box for "search" (in the search bar) --> (label)
