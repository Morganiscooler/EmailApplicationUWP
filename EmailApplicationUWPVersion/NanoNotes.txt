SCOPE
The idea is to make a web browser on the right side that shows the actual gmail app.
On the left it is goign to show the result of the information list we scalp from the gmail web browser,
such as
inbox, spam, trash, favorite

inside each tab will bring the information up from the web browser

we also want a search bar to search and filter our items in our tab window.





TODO 
Get rid of + 
Figure out window resizing, 75% - CANT DISABLE THE RESIZING IN A UWP APP
Figure out the icons you want
Add the webview to the right
Add another container into the tabs, so that will populate the email list stuff
Search bar that will do that
the logic that will sync between gmail and the list population, and changing the gmail.

LIST CONTAINER:
on each of the list items - three dots ... - gives you more options 
to left of 3 dots will be the pins, then to the left trash can, then to the left of that it will be favorites
This will be multiline, the preview will be below the subject line.
scroll bar on right side




Version 2
Pin button
clicked -> remove all other mail besides the pinned mail from the view list.
This will make a label in the gmail, and then store that in the pinned label.
that's where our backend was coming from.
